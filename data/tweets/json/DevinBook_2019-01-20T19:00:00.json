McGraw co-produces, narrates and contributes music to an episode detailing his close friend Brett Favre's return to Green Bay as a member of the rival Minnesota Vikings. And Renner lends his voice to a two-part film examining the rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys, and the impact each franchise has had on its city.
