Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men - playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10029190505","name":"Live: NBA Basketball","description":"Live coverage from the National Basketball Association, the top basketball league in North America."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10029304530","name":"NBA Basketball"}},{"domain":{"id":"12","name":"Sports Team","description":"A sports team organization, like Arsenal and the Boston Celtics"},"entity":{"id":"706083888871768064","name":"Milwaukee Bucks"}},{"domain":{"id":"26","name":"Sports League","description":""},"entity":{"id":"706083889454813185","name":"NBA"}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_952218500189233152"]},"geo":{},"referenced_tweets":{},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2018-01-14 13:00:00","GameId":"201801140MIA"},{"author_id":"2590038542","source":"Twitter Web Client","conversation_id":"952217707256143875","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":63,"end":76,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"hashtags":[{"start":36,"end":40,"tag":"MVP"},{"start":41,"end":51,"tag":"whoyougot"},{"start":52,"end":62,"tag":"killingit"}],"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":78,"end":101,"url":"https://t.co/Uwtg4rxO0q","expanded_url":"https://www.bonanza.com/listings/542422020","display_url":"bonanza.com/listings/54242…"}]},"text":"Potential MVP candidate this year.  #MVP #whoyougot #killingit @Giannis_An34  https://t.co/Uwtg4rxO0q","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"id":"952217707256143875","created_at":"2018-01-13T16:36:07.000Z","context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{},"referenced_tweets":{},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2018-01-14 13:00:00","GameId":"201801140MIA"},{"author_id":"63706531","source":"Twitter for iPad","conversation_id":"952217482982404096","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":15,"end":28,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"hashtags":[{"start":2,"end":10,"tag":"NBAVote"}],"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":63,"end":86,"url":"https://t.co/iaLbJLTgIQ","expanded_url":"https://cards.twitter.com/cards/9gsnb/56ikr","display_url":"cards.twitter.com/cards/9gsnb/56…"}]},"text":"I #NBAVote for @Giannis_An34 because he makes basketball fun!!
