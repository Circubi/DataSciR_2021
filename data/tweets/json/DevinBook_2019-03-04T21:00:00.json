Each celebrity Each celebrity chooses one of 22 boxes, each containing a different amount of money, ranging from 1p to £250,000. He or she then opens the other 21 boxes by choosing one at a time. When a box is opened, the value contained in that box is taken off the board and cannot be won. At the end of each round (a maximum of six), the celebrity is made an offer by the Banker to buy the contestant's case. If the player accepts the offer, he or she wins that amount. If the offer is declined, the celebrity continues choosing boxes in the subsequent rounds. The game ends when the celebrity accepts the Banker's offer or ends up with just one box remaining (in addition to the their own box).
