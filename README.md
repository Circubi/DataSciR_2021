This github repository is part of the [Data Science with R](https://brain.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/kmd/DataSciR/ "Data Science with R") seminar 2021. 

The project aims to discover a significant impact of social media posts addressed to NBA players before matches with respect to their influence on these players’ game performance. For this purpose, we consider NBA players that are highly active on Twitter and extract tweets that are addressed to them within a short period of time before matches via the Twitter API. A sentiment analysis indicates the attitude of the posts and with the resulting sentiment polarity scores we test if there is a correlation between social media posts and players’ on-court performance.
