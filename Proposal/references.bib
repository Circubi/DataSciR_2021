	abstract = {Social media comprises communication websites that facilitate relationship forming between users from diverse backgrounds, resulting in a rich social structure. User generated content encourages inquiry and decision-making. Given the relevance of social media to various stakeholders, it has received significant attention from researchers of various fields, including information systems. There exists no comprehensive review that integrates and synthesises the findings of literature on social media. This study discusses the findings of 132 papers (in selected {IS} journals) on social media and social networking published between 1997 and 2017. Most papers reviewed here examine the behavioural side of social media, investigate the aspect of reviews and recommendations, and study its integration for organizational purposes. Furthermore, many studies have investigated the viability of online communities/social media as a marketing medium, while others have explored various aspects of social media, including the risks associated with its use, the value that it creates, and the negative stigma attached to it within workplaces. The use of social media for information sharing during critical events as well as for seeking and/or rendering help has also been investigated in prior research. Other contexts include political and public administration, and the comparison between traditional and social media. Overall, our study identifies multiple emergent themes in the existing corpus, thereby furthering our understanding of advances in social media research. The integrated view of the extant literature that our study presents can help avoid duplication by future researchers, whilst offering fruitful lines of enquiry to help shape research for this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Online athlete-generated content in social media has high potential to become the information source for both team managers and coaches to discern players' mood status and shaky performance before games. In the existing literature, either in psychology or sport analytics, there is a stream of research that investigated the relationship between athletes' mood and the individual sport performance, however, few of them discussed the causality from the social media perspective. In this study, we look deep into the Athlete-generated content ({AGC}) and aim to provide a more comprehensive framework to sport operators that incorporates players' social media content into their administrative decision-making process. We obtained a unique and extensive dataset of {AGC} for active {NBA} players (in the 2012-13 season) from Twitter and apply sentiment analysis technique to measure the general mood polarity of a player. The general mood was then incorporated into econometrics models to examine its effect on players' individual game performance. The results suggest that the mood of {NBA} player has significant effect on driving sport performance. This paper explores the possibility of using social media data to measure athletes' mood and predicting the sport performance.},

	doi = {10.24251/HICSS.2020.303},
	abstract = {Professional sports has evolved from a game to an organization that has been codified, strategized, and commercialized. One factor that is shaping the sports industry is the pervasiveness of social media. On the one hand, social media is used as a powerful medium for distributing and getting news, engaging in topical discussions, and empowering brands. On the other hand, social media has become a crucial mouthpiece for athletes to interact with peers, share opinions, thoughts, and feelings. However, millions of followers, tweets, and likes later, researchers, practitioners, and athletes alike ask whether social media has an impact on an athlete's performance. We conducted a social media usage and a sentiment analysis of 124,341 Twitter tweets extracted from 31 tennis athletes. We linked these data to 8,095 corresponding match day performances. The results show that high social media usage has a significant negative impact on athletes' performance.},

	abstract = {Collective moods are ubiquitous in social life. People may experience the sharing of a mood at a large sporting event, a concert or a religious ceremony, but also at a small family celebration or as part of a tour group. However, in philosophical discussions, collective moods are often framed as experiences of ecstasy, intoxication (Rausch) or even disinhibition at mass events without examining other aspects. Yet we practice and cultivate the sharing of moods in quite varied forms. In this paper I intend to offer a differentiating suggestion as to the levels and forms of the sharing of moods, drawing on discussions of shared feelings, work on the phenomenology of social understanding, and social theory.},

	abstract = {In recent years many parents, advocates and policy makers have expressed concerns regarding the potential negative impact of social media use. Some studies have indicated that social media use may be tied to negative mental health outcomes, including suicidality, loneliness and decreased empathy. Other studies have not found evidence for harm, or have indicated that social media use may be beneficial for some individuals. The current correlational study examined 467 young adults for their time spent using social media, importance of social media in their lives and tendency to engage in vaguebooking (posting unclear but alarming sounding posts to get attention). Outcomes considered included general mental health symptoms, suicidal ideation, loneliness, social anxiety and decreased empathy. Results indicated that social media use was not predictive of impaired mental health functioning. However, vaguebooking was predictive of suicidal ideation, suggesting this particular behavior could be a warning sign for serious issues. Overall, results from this study suggest that, with the exception of vaguebooking, concerns regarding social media use may be misplaced.},

Accordingly, this article contributes to this scarce literature. Six focus groups took place over 3 months with 54 adolescents aged 11–18 years, recruited from schools in Leicester and London ({UK}). Thematic analysis suggested that adolescents perceived social media as a threat to mental wellbeing and three themes were identified: (1) it was believed to cause mood and anxiety disorders for some adolescents, (2) it was viewed as a platform for cyberbullying and (3) the use of social media itself was often framed as a kind of ‘addiction’. Future research should focus on targeting and utilising social media for promoting mental wellbeing among adolescents and educating youth to manage the possible deleterious effects.},
