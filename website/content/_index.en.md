## The Impact of NBA player-related Social Media Posts on their on-court Performance - An Analysis
Welcome to our project website for the DataSciR-course of summer term 2021. On the following pages you can feel free to explore all facets of our project, starting with a brief overview screencast. On the "Introduction" page we shortly describe the motivation behind our core research question and on "Datasets" you can gain insights into the data resources we obtained. The "Exploratory Data Analysis" page then describes our core section of the project including the necessary deliverables to answer the hypothesis we set up. An additional predictive model that got incorporated as a consequence from our results in the analysis section can be found under the same name, investigating the impact of our sentiments on a performance prediction. Finally we wrap up our findings and results in the "Conclusion" section.
<br> Thank you for joining us and have fun!
