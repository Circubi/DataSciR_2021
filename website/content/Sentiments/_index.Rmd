## 3. Sentiments

The following sentiment lexica were used to compute the sentiments for each tweet: 

- **_Bing_** : positive/negative word list 
- **_Syuzhet_** : word list with sentiment scores reaching from -1 to 1 
- **_Jockers-Rinker_** : combined version of the Jocker's Syuzhet lexicon and Rinker's augmented Bing lexicon 
- **_NRC_** : positive/negative word list 
- **_AFINN_** : word list with sentiments reaching on a discrete scale from -5 to 5 
- **_Novak_** : list of emojis with sentiment scores reaching from -1 to 1

Each lexicon is applied to the raw text of each tweet to calculate the sentiment scores. The results of the sentiment analysis are displayed in the Sentiment Analysis subpage.
