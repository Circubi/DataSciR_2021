<h2>5. Predictive Model</h2>

<h3>5.1 Model Design</h3>
<p>One attempt to check whether the sentiments have an influence on the player’s performance at all and therefore to investigate our findings in the correlation analysis, was to set up a random forest regression model to predict the BPM of players. The idea was to set up different models and compare the predictions of performance with and without the sentiments as input features:</p>
<ul>
<li>mean BPM of the last 5 BPMs as a baseline model</li>
<li>model including only the sentiment scores</li>
<li>model including the last 5 BPMs, Position, Age, Month of the Game, Homegame, Trend, SRS_Team, SRS_Opponent</li>
<li>model including the last 5 BPMs, Position, Age, Month of the Game, Homegame, Trend, SRS_Team, SRS_Opponent and the sentiment scores</li>
</ul>
<p>In detail, Homegame expresses whether the player played a homegame (1) or an away game (0). The Trend indicates the teams last 5 game performances - i.e. the sum of wins (+1) and losses (-1) is calculated. In order to measure a more longterm team performance we used the SRS (Simple Rating System) which gives a score to each team according to their average point difference and strength of schedule and where 0 marks the average score. The SRS for the previous season was used for the prediction.</p>

<h3>5.2 Predictions</h3>
<p>For the actual prediction task we started by selecting
the relevant columns for the model and split the data
into training and testing data with a proportion of 75%
training to 25% testing. A validation split of 20% of
the training set was then performed data in order to
combat overfitting. Then each model was created using
the recipe package. Using tune_grid(), the model
parameter mtry (number of predictors that will be
randomly sampled at each split when creating the tree
models), trees (number of trees contained in the
ensemble) and min_n (minimum number of data points in a
node that are required for the node to be split
further) got tuned. After tuning, the best model fit
got choosen based on the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
which calculates the average distance between the
predicted values and the actual values, i.e. the lower
the RMSE, the better the model is able to fit a
dataset. The importance score for each variable was
saved as well.</p>
<p>In order to determine which model predicted the BPM
performance best, a visualization is shown below that
displays the predicted value (y-axis) and the true value
(x-axis) for each model, meaning a perfectly fitted model
would have all predictions on the the 45° line. The
visualization doesn’t allow for a clear interpretation since
all models are scattered and no specific trend can be
observed.</p>

<h3>5.3 RMSE and RSQ</h3>
<p><img src="/Predictive Model/_index_files/figure-html/modelvisualisation_metrics-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Therefore, to determine which model predicted the values
best, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error: calculates the average distance between the
predicted values and the actual values) and RSQ (R-Squared: proportion of variance in
the dependent variable that can be explained by the
independent variables) was used to further analyze the
different models.
The bar plot shows that the RMSE are in the range of 7.7 - 8.15. Using RMSE as a metric the model without sentiment scores predicts
the BPM best. The difference between the models’s RSQ on the
other hand is quite large. Here, all models don’t explain the
BPM well ranging from 0.0186973 to 0.0186973.
The models including sentiments predict the BPM performance
best, directly followed by the model without sentiments.
So even here, a direct influence of the sentiments as a
feature can not be derived from the model, underlining our
findings in the correlation analysis that the sentiments have no significant influence on a player’s in-game performance.</p>

<h2>5.4 Variable Importance Scores</h2>
<p><img src="/Predictive Model/_index_files/figure-html/modelvisualisation_variableimportance-1.png" width="960" /><img src="/Predictive Model/_index_files/figure-html/modelvisualisation_variableimportance-2.png" width="960" /><img src="/Predictive Model/_index_files/figure-html/modelvisualisation_variableimportance-3.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>A last step we did was to look at the importance scores of each sentiment analyzer method for the model including sentiments. Here it can be observed that the syuzhet and jockers_rinker sentiment scores rank first and second. The (permutation) importance score is calculated by (1) measuring a basline RSQ , (2) permuting the values of one feature and measure the RSQ. The importance score is the difference between the basline and the drop in overall RSQ caused by the permutation.
The plot indicates a high influence of sentiment scores, but since the model has a low RSQ, this should be perceived carefully.</p>
